# Mii Origins <span class="version">v1.0.0</span>

Before the Big Bang, there was another Universe, called Mera. Mera had very different laws of physics that we know today, and elements not present on our periodic table. Mystic elements with powerful abilities, and yet, unable to create life.

Mera was filled with energy and matter, and mindless celestial bodies known as Titans. Cronus was the biggest Titan of all, and was getting bigger by consuming everything on his way, threating Mera with a devastating end.

Before the danger of the complete emptyness, everywhere and forever, 9 of the Mera's enchanted elements combined together, releasing a new form of energy across the universe, energy that made Mera to grow emotional.

The fear Mera felt, made her strong enough to push Cronus to the very edge of her.
Ironically, with the exodus of Cronus from Mera's cosmic balance, Mera caused her own destruction, because the Titan underwent to a massive reaction and expansion, replacing Mera with a newborn universe. What we know today as Big Bang.

However, somewhere beyond the boundaries of our world, there is still a small part of Mera left, surviving the space expansion. A place where someone could observe all the universe. That's where Mii was born.

During the initial singularity, Carbon and Hydrogen escaped the gravitation of the human universe, and entered Mera's time and space. Those human elements together with Mera's unique matter, created the certain conditions for the origins of Mii's life.

Due the nature of her creation, Mii has both Mera and Human characteristics, although she wasn't always as we knew her, but she was evolved through time, and still does.

## Early years and departure from Mera
Mii spent most of her life alone in the remaining's of Mera, playing with Mera's floating rocks, that she mastered to move with her mind. As she was evolving, she started to feel lonely, and her curiocity was getting bigger to know what was outside her world. 

So she rode a rock and tried to pass Mera's borders. This was the first time Mii wasn't alone, because 9 more rocks followed her to her journey. Those rocks were vitalized with the original 9 elements that gave feelings to Mera.

When Mii crossed the line between Mera and our World, herself was projected in both places, but neither her instances were now able to enter or exit their universe. Actually that how Mii got her name. "M" stands for Mera, and II is the latin two (or two I's), because the Earth Mii is the second Mii.

Mii stayed in that same spot for millions of years, crying. Poor Mii, gained and lost a sister in a moment.

Realizing there was nothing she could do, Mii now travels alone on the top of an asteroids grid (master rock + 9 elements + smaller space rocks she collects from various places in galaxy), and she built a radar searching for intelligent life. She recently received signals from  Earth satellites, and her curiocity was unimaginable when she found out the same symbol she had on her face in our planet.

So she's coming..

 
| Personality   |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Species | Merian + Human, but mostly Merian. Mii is believed to be the only of their kind in the universe | 
| Gender  | Mii is reffered as "she" because she looks like a girl, although she hasn't really a gender |
| B-Day| June 9 |
| Age  | ~14 billion years old, but it's much less with her current form  |
| Height | 175cm / 5.7" |
| Weight | 58kg / 127lbs | 
| Personality | Curious and smart ([according to ChatGTP](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxMZfev43VmagYF4VVRWnK7I7CooxOGt8r) ü•≤), but with very low social skills, since Mii was always alone. She has no respect for anything, including the human life, but she could sacrifice herself for what she loves |
| Symbols | Mii has a red symbol on her right cheek, but it is unknown how she got it, or what it does. Sporadically changes color depending her emotions though |
| She speaks | English, Japanese, Rust|
| Favorite Song | [MERA MERA - Mori Calliope](https://open.spotify.com/album/2kgTd0HIj4SUtlmTD6kuzo?si=hgIcEaWWS1u_zxVmeJUsaA) |



| Abilities     |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Indestructible | Mii skin is soft, but there's nothing that can penatrate or damage it |
| Telekinisis | Mii can move her asteroid grid with her mind, however their phycic abilities cannot interact with other objects |
| Survival | Mii doesn't need food, water or oxygen to survive, and she doesn't age but keeps evolving. She consumes energy from her asteroids, but getting very far from them it can get her killed |
| Damage  | Her asteroids still have physics from Mera Universe, and they can travel with tens of times the speed of light. Mii can accurate target them to anything she wants. In fact, Mii has the potential to rotate her asteroids grid so fast, that it will create a force that can suck the whole universe instantly. That's known as the **Reversed Big Bang ü§Ø** |
| Quantum State | Mii exists in both Mera and Human universes at the same time. Each of her selves is trapped on that cosmos, and can't get in or get our. Mii sometimes has visions of her other self. If she gets killed in one place, then she dies in both
| Lightning | Mii can create lightning particles, like sparkles, but those are harmeless, mostly for a show off.
